YOLO_DETECTION INSTRUCTIONS

yolo_detection.py has two main functions:
	save_tagged_frames(vid, output) which takes a video filename and an output folder and YOLO tags frames in "real-time", outputs the fps of the video
		"real time" - times how long each tag takes, then waits that long until tagging the next frame
	create_tagged_video(outputs, video_output, fps)	which takes the output pictures file, the filename of the output_video, and the fps 
		and saves the video as though it was being tagged in real time. The function knows exactly how long to wait before loading the next frame to the video

Go to https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3 and follow all yolo-pytorch installation rules before running
make sure working directory is in Pytorch-Yolo

EXAMPLE USAGE:


fps = ('../pano1.avi', '../output')
# this will take a while
create_tagged_video('../output', '../tagged_pano1.avi', fps)
